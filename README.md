gap期间的资料整理（Data collation during the gap period）
2024.05.06-2024.12.05忙于处理重大家庭变故，2024.12.07开始重新收拾心情和状态，重新学习和调整。这个过程中一些思考和学习笔记放在这个目录做一个备忘。2025春节后一并逐步push到这个project。


From May 6, 2024, to December 5, 2024, I was occupied with handling a major family  upheaval. On December 7, 2024, I started to regain my composure and adjust my state, and resumed learning and self - adjustment. Some thoughts and study notes during this process are placed in this directory as a memo. After the Spring Festival in 2025, I will gradually push them to this project.



2024.05-2024.12中间的7个月经历了非常刻骨铭心的剧烈动荡，处理完这些事情后生活逐步走上正轨，开始重新跟进技术演进和思考下一步做什么。虽然在居家，但是仍然做了一些调整：

1.每天保持正常的作息，按时起床，就餐，运动。


2.在家时不穿睡衣，保持正常着装。


3.上午追踪技术新闻和热点。


4.下午看技术资料和编程。


5.晚上汇总简历和工作信息。


保持乐观向上的心态，积极的去生活。**积极从来都是一个动词，不是一个形容词，无论怎样要好好去生活**。***哪怕满路风霜，总有艳阳高照的一天！***




***感谢这个过程中一直陪伴、支持和鼓励我的家人和朋友们！***





From May 2024 to December 2024, during those seven months, I experienced extremely profound and intense upheavals. After dealing with these matters, my life gradually got back on track, and I started to follow up on technological evolution again and think about what to do next. Although I was staying at home, I still made some adjustments:


1.Maintain a regular daily routine, getting up, having meals, and exercising on time every day.


2.Don't wear pajamas at home, but keep normal attire.


3.Track technological news and hot topics in the morning.


4.Read technical materials and do programming in the afternoon.


5.Compile resumes and work information in the evening.


Keep an optimistic and positive attitude and live life actively. **Positivity has always been a verb, not an adjective. No matter what, we should live life to the fullest**. ***Even if the road is full of hardships, there will always be a sunny day!***



***Thanks to my family and friends who have been accompanying, supporting and encouraging me throughout this process!***
