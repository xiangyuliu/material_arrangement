gap期间的资料整理（Data collation during the gap period）
2024.05.06-2024.12.05忙于处理重大家庭变故，2024.12.07开始重新收拾心情和状态，重新学习和调整。这个过程中一些思考和学习笔记放在这个目录做一个备忘。2025春节后一并逐步push到这个project。


From May 6, 2024, to December 5, 2024, I was occupied with handling a major family  upheaval. On December 7, 2024, I started to regain my composure and adjust my state, and resumed learning and self - adjustment. Some thoughts and study notes during this process are placed in this directory as a memo. After the Spring Festival in 2025, I will gradually push them to this project.
